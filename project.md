## Overview

In this project, you will take on the role of a data analyst asked to support a real-world decision using data. Rather than following a step-by-step recipe, your team will be responsible for defining the question, assembling and analyzing data, and communicating results to an audience that needs to act on your findings.

In many professional settings (e.g., business, policy, consulting, and research) analysts are rarely handed a perfectly defined problem. Instead, they are asked to clarify goals, make reasonable assumptions, work with imperfect data, and deliver insights that are useful under real constraints. This project is designed to mirror that experience.

You will work in a team of **three** to investigate a question that genuinely interests you. You may choose a topic related to business, agriculture, environmental issues, public policy, as long as your question can be addressed using regression or forecasting methods and available data. Choosing a topic you care about is encouraged: analysts do better work when they are curious about the system they are studying.

Your task is not to build the most complex model possible. Your task is to build a model that helps someone make a better decision. This means thinking carefully about:

- Who the decision maker is
- What outcome they care about
- What information would actually change their behavior

By the end of the project, you should be able to explain not only what you did, but why you did it, and why someone should trust your results.

**Group size: 3 students**

## A. Proposal 

The proposal defines the scope and direction of your project. Its purpose is to ensure that your team has a clear, feasible, and well-motivated plan before investing time in data collection and modeling.

- Your proposal should be approximately 1–2 pages and must include:
- A clear description of the decision problem or question
- Identification of the intended decision maker
- The outcome variable of interest and why it matters
- Whether the goal is forecasting or explaining relationships
- The unit of observation
- Proposed data sources
- A brief description of the planned regression or forecasting approach

The proposal should demonstrate that your question is answerable with available data and methods covered in this course. Instructor feedback at this stage is intended to help refine your project, not to lock you into a final design.

| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Exceeds expectations**       | The proposal clearly defines a compelling and realistic decision problem. The outcome, decision maker, and unit of observation are well aligned. Data sources are appropriate and feasible. The proposed modeling approach is well motivated and demonstrates strong analytical judgment. |
| **Meets expectations**         | The proposal defines a clear question and outcome. Data sources and methods are generally appropriate, though some elements may need refinement. The project appears feasible and relevant to course objectives.                                                                          |
| **Does not meet expectations** | The proposal is vague, unrealistic, or poorly aligned with available data or methods. Key elements (decision context, outcome, unit of observation, or data source) are missing or unclear.                                                                                               |

## B. Written Report 

The written report presents your full analysis and is the primary record of your work. It should be written for an intelligent but non-technical audience and emphasize interpretation and decision relevance over technical detail.

The report should be concise (approximately 6–8 pages, excluding tables and figures) and include:

- An executive summary that highlights key findings and recommendations
- Background and decision context
- Data description, including sources and limitations
- Modeling approach and justification
- Results and interpretation of coefficients or forecasts
- Discussion of uncertainty, assumptions, and limitations
- Conclusions and actionable recommendations

Clear writing, well-designed tables and figures, and logical organization are essential.

## C. Oral Presentation 

The oral presentation communicates your project’s key insights to an audience of decision makers. The goal is not to walk through every technical detail, but to explain what you found, why it matters, and what should be done as a result.

Presentations should be 10–12 minutes and include:

- A clear statement of the problem and decision context
- A brief overview of data and approach
- Key results and their interpretation
- Implications and recommendations
- Visuals that support, rather than distract from, the message

All group members are expected to participate.

## D. Replication Materials (Data and Code)

Your replication materials must allow another analyst to reproduce your results. This includes cleaned data files and clearly written code used for data processing, analysis, and figure generation.

Materials should include:

- Raw or source data references
- Cleaned datasets used in analysis
- Well-organized, commented code
- Clear file structure and naming conventions

Reproducibility is a core professional standard in data analysis.

## E. Individual Reflection and Peer Review

Each student will submit an individual reflection that focuses on both teamwork and analytical learning. This reflection is an opportunity to step back from the final product and critically assess the project as a whole.

In addition to describing your contributions and evaluating teamwork, you should reflect on the analytical decisions your group made and what you learned from the process. In professional settings, analysts are often asked not only to deliver results, but also to explain what they would do differently with more time, better data, or additional information. This reflection mirrors that expectation.

Your reflection should address the following points:

- A clear description of your individual contributions to the project
- An assessment of how your team functioned (communication, division of labor, coordination)
- Thoughtful reflection on the analysis itself, including:
  - What worked well in your approach
  - What you would change if you were starting the project again
  - What additional data, methods, or checks you would pursue with more time
- Constructive and professional feedback on the contributions of your teammates

Reflections should be specific and concrete. Vague statements (e.g., “we would collect better data” or “we would improve the model”) should be avoided in favor of clear, actionable insights.

Peer evaluations may be used to adjust individual grades.

| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Exceeds expectations**       | The reflection is thoughtful, specific, and demonstrates deep engagement with the project. The student clearly explains their contributions, critically evaluates analytical choices, and provides concrete ideas for how the project could be improved if done again. Peer feedback is constructive and professional. |
| **Meets expectations**         | The reflection adequately describes contributions and team dynamics. The student reflects on the project and identifies areas for improvement, though discussion may be general or limited in depth. Peer feedback is appropriate.                                                                                     |
| **Does not meet expectations** | The reflection is superficial, incomplete, or missing. Contributions are unclear, reflection on the analysis is minimal or absent, or peer feedback is unconstructive or unprofessional.                                                                                                                               |
