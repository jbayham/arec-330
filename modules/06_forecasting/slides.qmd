# Forecasting for Decision-Making
From patterns in data $\rightarrow$ real-world decisions

## Opening Scenario: Arches National Park

It is October. You must decide for next summer:

- How many seasonal staff to hire
- Whether to implement reservations
- How many shuttle buses to contract
- How much overtime to budget

What information do you wish you had?

**Expected visitation.**

Forecasting reduces uncertainty about the future.

## What Is Forecasting?

Forecasting is:

> A transparent, testable prediction about future values based on past patterns.

Forecasting is not:

- Guessing
- A crystal ball
- A guarantee

Forecasting is:

- A model of how the world has behaved
- With quantified uncertainty
- Evaluated on held-out data

## Why Forecasting Matters in Business and Policy{.scrollable}

### Operations
- Staffing
- Inventory
- Capacity planning

### Finance
- Revenue projections
- Budgeting
- Capital planning

### Public policy
- Emergency planning
- Infrastructure investment
- Tourism management

Without forecasts:

- Overstaffing $\rightarrow$ wasted money
- Understaffing $\rightarrow$ congestion and poor experience
- Misallocated budgets

## Forecasting Is About Decisions, Not Accuracy Alone

> A forecast is useful only relative to the decision it informs.

Two models can have similar accuracy, but:

- One consistently overpredicts
- One consistently underpredicts

Those create different costs.

- Overpredict visitation $\rightarrow$ overspend on staffing
- Underpredict visitation $\rightarrow$ overcrowding and safety risk

Forecast evaluation must consider **decision costs**.

## Example: Arches National Park

:::{.notes}
Use the raw visitation time series to ask:

- When are visits highest?
- What happens around 2020?
- If planning for 2026, what concerns arise?

Economic context:

- COVID shock
- Reservation system period
- Policy shifts

> Structural breaks complicate forecasting.


Use the same raw series shown in lab to connect lecture and lab.

## The Forecasting Problem

Every forecast must answer:

1. What patterns exist?
   - Trend
   - Seasonality
   - Cycles
   - Shocks
2. Will those patterns continue?
3. How uncertain are we?

Forecasting requires statistical knowledge and good judgment.

## Sources of Predictability

Time series are easier to forecast when:

- Trend is persistent
- Seasonality is stable
- Autocorrelation is strong

Forecasting is harder with:

- Sudden policy changes
- Structural breaks
- Technological shifts
- Extreme shocks

Application: reservation removal in 2026.

## The Role of Benchmarks

Before complex models, ask:

> Can you beat "same month last year"?

Seasonal naive is strong because:

- Seasonality is often dominant
- No parameter estimation required
- It adapts automatically

Lesson:

**Complexity does not guarantee improvement.**

## Train/Test Split and Honest Evaluation

> Never evaluate a forecast on data used to estimate it.

- Training set $\rightarrow$ estimate model parameters
- Test set $\rightarrow$ simulate future performance

Without out-of-sample evaluation, you reward overfitting.

Connection to course workflow:

EDA $\rightarrow$ Model $\rightarrow$ Evaluation $\rightarrow$ Decision

## What Makes a Good Forecast?{.scrollable}

Not just low error.

A good forecast is:

- Transparent
- Interpretable
- Robust to shocks
- Stable across samples
- Appropriate for the decision horizon

Example:

- Short-term staffing decision
- 10-year infrastructure expansion

Different horizons imply different model choices.

## Forecasting Horizon Matters

Short horizon:

- Autocorrelation dominates
- Naive methods are often strong

Long horizon:

- Trend assumptions dominate
- Structural change risk increases

Would you use the same model for:

- Next month?
- Next year?
- Ten years?

## Forecasting Under Policy Change

Arches reservation policy:

- Introduced in 2020
- Removed in 2026

Key modeling question:

Should you assume:

- Past pattern continues?
- New regime starts?
- Structural break at policy change?

> Forecasting involves causal reasoning, not just extrapolation.

## Forecasts and Uncertainty

Point forecast $\neq$ full forecast.

Decision-makers need:

- Prediction intervals
- Range of plausible outcomes
- Worst-case planning inputs
- Risk assessment context

Applications:

- Fire risk planning
- Tourism congestion management

## The Economic Cost of Forecast Errors

Suppose July error is 50,000 visitors.

What does that mean economically?

- Staff shortfall or overstaffing
- Parking congestion
- Lost revenue opportunities
- Overtime and contracting costs

MAE and RMSE are proxies for decision cost.

## When Forecasting Fails

Forecasts fail when:

- Structural breaks occur
- Policy changes behavior
- Climate shocks hit demand
- Pandemics disrupt patterns
- Models extrapolate unstable trends

> Most models assume the future resembles the past.

That assumption is fragile.

## Why Decomposition Makes Sense

Most economic time series combine:

- Trend
- Seasonality
- Irregular shocks

Decomposition helps by:

- Separating patterns
- Improving interpretability
- Supporting better forecasts

$$
y_t = T_t + S_t + R_t
$$

## Forecasting Is Iterative

Forecasting is not: fit once, done.

Forecasting is:

1. Fit
2. Evaluate
3. Diagnose bias
4. Update assumptions
5. Refit

Especially important when policy regimes change.

## Linking Back to Business Analytics

In this course pipeline:

- EDA $\rightarrow$ understand structure
- Modeling $\rightarrow$ estimate relationships
- Forecasting $\rightarrow$ project forward
- Evaluation $\rightarrow$ test performance
- Decision $\rightarrow$ allocate resources

Forecasting is the bridge between data and planning.

## Discussion Prompt

If Arches removes reservations in 2026,
how would you forecast 2027 visitation?

Possible strategies:

- Ignore reservation-period years
- Add a policy indicator
- Weight pre-policy years more heavily
- Build scenario forecasts

## Optional 10-Minute Case Activity

Scenario: "Visitation is expected to be 15% higher than last year."

Before hiring 20 more seasonal staff, what else do you need?

- Forecast uncertainty and interval width
- Timing within the season
- Budget constraints
- Operational bottlenecks

Forecasts support decisions under uncertainty.

## Big Takeaway

Forecasting is not about predicting perfectly.

Forecasting is about:

- Quantifying uncertainty
- Improving decisions
- Learning from forecast errors
- Updating beliefs with new data
