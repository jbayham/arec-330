## Introduction to R

Welcome to the world of R programming! R is a powerful and widely used programming language in the field of data analysis and statistical computing. It is known for its vast collection of libraries and packages that allow users to easily perform complex data manipulation and analysis tasks.

Before we get started, you will need to install R on your computer. You can download the latest version of R for free from the official website <https://cran.r-project.org/>. Once the installation is complete, you will also need to install RStudio, a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for R. You can download RStudio from the official website <https://rstudio.com/>. Alternatively, you will have access to a version of RStudio on a CSU server that you can access via web browser here: <http://darecompute-01.aggie.colostate.edu:8787/>.  I will provide you with log in credentials in class.

RStudio provides a user-friendly interface for working with R and offers a variety of features to make working with R easier and more efficient.  Open up RStudio and you should see something that looks like this:

The RStudio interface is divided into several panels:

- The Console panel is where you can enter and run R commands.

- The Source panel is where you can open and edit R scripts, which are files that contain R code.

- The Environment and History panels display information about the current environment and command history.

- The Files, Plots, Packages, and Help panels provide access to various resources and tools.

Now that you have both R and RStudio installed and running, let's dive into some basic concepts of the R programming language.

First, R is an interpreted language, which means that you can enter commands directly into the console and see the results immediately. You can start the R console by opening RStudio and clicking on the "Console" tab.

### Basics

To assign a value to a variable in R, you can use the assignment operator `<-` or `=` like this:


```{r}
x <- 5

x = 5 #Does the same thing
```

Here, we have created a variable called `x` and assigned it the value of 5.  Anything following the hashtag on the same line is interpreted as a comment and not executed. Once you assign a variable a value, you can see it in your environment panel.  You can use the `print()` function to display the value of a variable:
```{r}
print(x)
```

>Stop and open a new R script.  Because R is a command-line application, we can write a script (i.e., text file) with a sequence of commands.  There are many benefits to scripting.  First, you can save a record of the commands if you need to reproduce the analysis.  Second, you can share it with others so they can reproduce it. Third, you can easily change a part of your script to see what happens.**

You can also perform basic arithmetic operations in R using the standard operators (`+, -, *, /`):
```{r}
y <- 3
z <- x + y
print(z)
```

First, we assign the variable `y` the value 3.  Then, we assign `z` the value of `x` (assigned 5 earlier) plus `y` (just assigned 3), which sum to 8.

*Comprehension check: Try assigning the variables `a` and `b` different values and dividing them.*

### Data types

R also has a wide range of data types, including: numerical, character, and logical.  Variables can be different datatypes.  Collections of variables are called a vector - a one-dimensional array of data.  You can create a vector using the "c()" function, which stands for concatenate.  A vector may only contain one type of data.

```{r}
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
characters <- c("a", "b", "c")
logical <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
```


### Indexing

A single entry in a vector is called an element. You can access elements of a vector using the square bracket notation:

```{r}
print(numbers[1])
```

*Comprehension check: Try accessing a different element of the vector `numbers` or one of the other vectors.*

You can also access series of elements in the vector.  To access a continuous range of values use the colon `:`
```{r}
print(characters[2:3])
```

You can even use a vector of index values to call discontinuous subsets of the vector.
```{r}
print(characters[c(1,3)])
```
  
Depending on the data type, there are functions that operate on the vector.  For example, you can sum the elements of the numeric vector `numbers`.
```{r}
print(sum(numbers))
```

*Comprehension check: Can you sum the numbers of the vector `characters`?  How about logical?*


*Challenge: Can you figure out how to calculate the product of the vector `numbers`?*

You can also add, subtract, multiply, and divide all of the numbers in a vector
```{r}
print(numbers+5)
```

Or add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers of equal-length vectors
```{r}
print(numbers + numbers*2)
```

### data.frames

Using R like a fancy calculator is intended to help you understand how R works.  R is generally used to analyze data sets.  Data sets are collections of equal-length vectors in a table or what R calls a `data.frame`. Here is a simple example:
```{r}
print(data.frame(a=c(1:3),
                 b=c(4:6),
                 d=c(7:9)))
```
Where `a,b,d` are the column or variable names and the `1,2,3` on the far left are row numbers.

You can build a data.frame using the vectors above and assign the object a name.
```{r}
df <- data.frame(numbers=numbers[1:3],
                 characters,
                 logical)

print(df)
```

*Comprehension check: Why did I subset the vector numbers?*


### Packages or Libraries

Finally, R has a vast collection of libraries or packages that provide a wide range of functions for data manipulation and analysis. Since R is open source, anyone can write libraries and share them with the world.^[If you like this concept, you might explore the linux operating system. I use [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download).] You can install and load a package using the "install.packages()" and "library()" functions:

```{r}
#Run only once 
#install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
```


Here, we have installed and loaded the "dplyr" package, which provides a wide range of functions for data manipulation. Note that you only need to install packages once, but you need to load them using the `library()` command each session. If you are working on the server, the packages you need will be installed; you just need to load them.

### Running scripts and saving output

We have been building a script (a text file with a series of commands in R - like a recipe). Suppose that script analyzed some data and produced some outputs. You may want to have R run all of the commands in your script. The command to run a script in R is:  `source()`. There is also a button called source in the upper right corner of the source panel. You can call that command directly in the R console. Suppose you have an R script called `lab_01_example.R` in your current working directory. You can run it by typing the following in the console: `source("lab_01_example.R",echo=TRUE)`. The `echo` argument set to `TRUE` tells R to print the output of each command. 

Assignments in this class will require you to demonstrate that your code runs without errors. You can use `source()` along with another function called `sink()` to generate a log file that you can use to show evidence that your R code runs. To create a log file that demonstrates the script, `lab_01_example.R`, runs, open a new script and type the following three commands (lines) into the new script (or directly into the R console):
```{r}
#| eval: false
sink(file = "lab_01_example.log")
source("lab_01_example.R",echo = TRUE)
sink()
```

The `sink()` command is strange - it opens an active connection to a blank text file called `lab_01_example.log`, then writes the output of any following commands (i.e., `source("lab_01_example.R",echo = TRUE)`) into that file. The last `sink()` command simply closes the connection, so you can keep using R without writing everything to your log file. 

### Documentation

Documentation is critical to understanding how functions and packages work in R.  There is a help tab in the lower right panel in RStudio.  You can also place your cursor in the function name in your code and press F1 to bring up the help for that function.  R documentation always provides a brief description, information about arguments (or inputs), information about outputs, and some examples of how you would use it.  Learning to read the documentation is critical for learning new packages.

## Introduction to VS Code

[Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a free, open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It is a popular choice among developers due to its versatility, ease of use, and extensive range of features. VS Code supports a wide range of programming languages and provides a variety of tools and extensions to enhance the coding experience.

While I still prefer RStudio for R programming, VS Code is a great general-purpose code editor that has better AI integration. Before we get to the AI integration, lets configure VS Code to run R code. 

Find the extensions tab on the left panel of VS Code. Search for and install the extension called "R". This extension allows you to run R code in VS Code.

Let's find the script we wrote in RStudio and run the commands in VS Code.
