## Customer Churn

![](https://miro.medium.com/1*0TFMuTvMfnLyMa1fjjuFTg.jpeg)

:::{.notes}
Churn is the fraction of customers that don't return/continue buying. Companies often analyze churn rates.

:::{.notes}
Companies often have detailed data on their customers and want to predict churn - how likely customers are to leave
:::

## ML model produces good prediction

::::{.columns}

:::{.column}
![](includes/confusion_matrix.png)
:::

:::{.column}
Accuracy = 0.98

Precision = .96

Recall = 0.98

:::

::::

:::{.notes}
Accuracy: The fraction of all predictions the model gets right. (tp + tn) / (tp + tn + fp + fn) =  (446 + 1494)/(446 + 1494 + 16 + 7)
Precision: Among customers the model predicts will churn, how many actually do? tp / (tp + fp) = 446/(16 + 446)
Recall: Among customers who actually churn, how many did the model catch? tp / (tp + fn) = 446/(446 + 7)
:::

## This looks like success

- High accuracy
- High precision
- High recall
- Clean evaluation

By most technical standards:

> **This is a very good model.**


##  {.iclicker}

:::{.question}
What question does this model actually answer?
:::
:::{.choices}
A. Why customers churn  
B. Which customers will churn  
C. How to prevent churn  
D. Whether churn is costly
:::

:::{.notes}
B which customers will churn
:::

## Now what?

You can predict which customers will stay and which will leave.

How do you make a data-driven decision?


## Taking a step back...

We need to make sure our analysis is answering a question

The question is formulated around the decision

The decision should solve a problem


## Why should we care about churn?
:::{.incremental}
- **Problem**: Customer churn is expensive 

- **Goal**: We want to reduce churn by retaining more customers

- **Question**: Why are customers leaving?
:::

:::{.notes}
attracting new customers is 5x more expensive than retaining existing customers
:::

## Exploring the data...
:::{.incremental}
- We find that customers leave when satisfaction falls

- We then find that satisfaction falls when customers don't feel valued (measured by survey and focus groups)

- Do any of our existing programs increase satisfaction? loyalty discounts, mailers, early access?
:::

## Decision-oriented question

:::{.main-point}
Which program (loyalty discounts, mailers, early access) increases satisfaction, thereby reducing churn?
:::

## Pair up and discuss


- What business decisions are you familiar with? 

- Were the decisions related to a particular problem?

- Dissect the business decision into: <br> 
  *problem, goals, and decision-oriented questions* 

5 minutes to discuss then be ready to share out


# A Framework

for data-driven decision making


## Start by understanding the problem
:::{.main-point}
```{mermaid}
%%{init: {"themeVariables": {"fontSize": "24px"}}}%%
flowchart LR
  G[Goals] ==> P[Problem]
  P ==> Q[Question]
  Q ==> Da[Data]
  Da ==> M[Model]
  M ==> R[Result]
  R ==> D[Decision]
```
:::

:::{.notes}
- Move from understanding the problemto formulating a clear question. 
- Then finding data and appropriate model. This part requires advanced stats and understanding of measures of fit. 
- Then when comfortable with the model, run and get results and make decision.
:::

## Reality is more complicated
:::{.main-point}
```{mermaid}
%%{init: {"themeVariables": {"fontSize": "24px"}}}%%

  G[Goals] ==> P[Problem]
  P ==> Q[Question]
  Q ==> Da[Data]
  Da ==> M[Model]
  M ==> R[Result]
  R ==> D[Decision]
  Da ==> Q
```
:::

:::{.notes}
- Data limitations may constrain the types of questions you can ask
- Exploring the data may also lead you to revise your questions

## Reality is very complicated

```
:::

:::{.notes}
- Modeling constrains can affect data collection, which again may lead to question revision
- Results can lead you to revise your model or even question
:::


## Where data/research projects usually fail

- The decision is unclear

- The question is vague or misaligned

- The data don’t measure the concept

- The unit of observation doesn’t match the claim

::: notes
Normalize this: professionals struggle here too. We'll practice fixing it.
:::

## What makes a “good” question?

A good empirical question is:

- Decision-relevant

- Answerable (with data you have or can acquire)

- Specific about:

    - Who/what (unit)

    - Where (one branch or whole enterprise)

    - When (timeline)

    - Compared to what (do nothing, )

::: notes
This slide sets the criteria; next slides operationalize with constraints.

##  {.iclicker}

A company asks: “What would happen to customer churn next year if we offered a retention discount at one location and not others?”

:::{.question}
What type of analytics question is this? (Heidari)
:::
:::{.choices}
A. Descriptive  
B. Exploratory  
C. Predictive  
D. Causal (counterfactual)  
E. Mechanistic
:::

:::{.notes}
D counterfactual
This question compares:

the world with the intervention

the world without the intervention

That makes it counterfactual, not just predictive.

Answering it usually requires:

experiments, quasi-experiments, or strong assumptions
:::



## Types of Questions (Heidari) {.scrollable}

- **Descriptive**  
  What is happening in the data? (summarize levels, averages, frequencies)

- **Exploratory**  
  Are there patterns, trends, or relationships worth investigating?

- **Inferential**  
  What can we conclude about a population based on a sample?

- **Predictive**  
  Given what we observe, what is likely to happen next?

- **Causal (Counterfactual)**  
  What would change if we intervene, compared to if we do nothing?

- **Mechanistic**  
  Through what process or structure does an outcome occur?

##  {.iclicker}

What percentage of customers churned last month?

:::{.question}
What type of analytics question is this? (Heidari)
:::
:::{.choices}
A. Descriptive  
B. Exploratory  
C. Predictive  
D. Causal (counterfactual)  
E. Mechanistic
:::

:::{.notes}
Correct answer: A. Descriptive. It summarizes what already happened.
:::


##  {.iclicker}

Through what process does customer dissatisfaction lead to churn?

:::{.question}
What type of analytics question is this? (Heidari)
:::
:::{.choices}
A. Descriptive  
B. Exploratory  
C. Predictive  
D. Causal (counterfactual)  
E. Mechanistic
:::

:::{.notes}
E. Mechanistic. Trying to understand why something is happening
:::


##  {.iclicker}

Is customer churn higher among users with low satisfaction scores?

:::{.question}
What type of analytics question is this? (Heidari)
:::
:::{.choices}
A. Descriptive  
B. Exploratory  
C. Predictive  
D. Causal (counterfactual)  
E. Mechanistic
:::

:::{.notes}
B. Exploratory. It looks for patterns or associations without claiming causality.
:::

## Key Takeaways

- Strong models do **not** guarantee good decisions  
- Data analysis should start with the **problem and decision**, not the data  
- Different decisions require **different types of questions**  
- Good questions are:
  - decision-relevant  
  - answerable with data  
  - clear about who, where, when, and compared to what
