## Recap


## Agenda

- The analyst’s workflow (the *whole* game)
- Zoom in: what makes a *good* question
- Asking the right question **given data constraints**
- How this sets up data acquisition + EDA

::: notes
This is the first "real content" lecture. Set expectations: we will build a repeatable workflow.
:::


## Quick reset from Week 1

Last week: **why** data analysis matters.

Starting today: **how** it actually works.

::: notes
Mark the transition clearly. Helps students shift mindset from motivation to craft.
:::


## What students think analysis is

:::{.main-point}
**Data → Model → Output**
:::

## What analysis actually is

**Problem → Question → Data → Method → Result → Decision**

> If you start with “model,” you’re already late.

::: notes
This is the course backbone. Keep coming back to it all semester.

## The loop (not a line)

  D[Decision] --> Q[Question]
  Q --> Da[Data]
  Da --> M[Method]
  M --> R[Result]
  R --> D
  R --> Q
  Da --> Q
```

::: notes
Emphasize iteration: results change questions; data constraints reshape questions.
:::

## Where projects usually fail

- The decision is unclear

- The question is vague or misaligned

- The data don’t measure the concept

- The unit of observation doesn’t match the claim

::: notes
Normalize this: professionals struggle here too. We'll practice fixing it.
:::

## Zoom in: What makes a “good” question?

A good empirical question is:

- Decision-relevant

- Answerable (with data you have or can acquire)

- Specific about:

    - Who/what (unit)

    - Where

    - When

    - Compared to what

::: notes
This slide sets the criteria; next slides operationalize with constraints.
:::


## A useful test

If you can’t say how the answer would change a decision, the question isn’t finished.

::: notes
Call on an example decision: policy choice, business action, resource allocation.
