# Lab 2 Rubric: *From Question to Data*

**Total points:** 100  
**Grading philosophy:**  

- Emphasis on clarity of reasoning and engagement with the data  
- Partial credit encouraged  
- Penalize vague, unreflective, or copy-pasted responses  

---

## Section A: Formulating the Question & Decision Context (25 points)

### Q2. Policy Question (10 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-:|------------------|
| 9–10  | Clear, focused, policy-relevant question that explicitly connects drought to corn productivity |
| 6–8   | Relevant question but vague or slightly misaligned (e.g., unclear outcome or population) |
| 3–5   | Loosely related; mixes multiple objectives or is too broad |
| 0–2   | Unclear, off-topic, or missing |

**Key indicators:**

- Mentions drought
- Mentions corn outcomes
- Answerable in principle with data

---

### Q3. Policy Decision Being Informed (8 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-:|------------------|
| 7–8   | Clearly identifies a concrete policy decision (e.g., support programs, assistance, intervention) |
| 4–6   | General decision mentioned but lacks specificity |
| 1–3   | Vague description of “learning” with no decision context |
| 0     | Not answered |

---

### Q4. Meaning of Productivity (7 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-:|------------------|
| 6–7   | Correctly distinguishes yield vs production vs acreage and selects an appropriate measure |
| 4–5   | Mentions correct measures but shows some confusion |
| 1–3   | Uses “productivity” vaguely or incorrectly |
| 0     | No meaningful response |

---

## Section B: Data Needs & Conceptual Understanding (20 points)

### Q5. Required Data & Unit of Observation (10 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-:|------------------|
| 9–10  | Clearly identifies key variables *and* the correct unit of observation |
| 6–8   | Identifies relevant variables but unit is unclear |
| 3–5   | Partial list of variables with little explanation |
| 0–2   | Very vague or incorrect |

---

### Q6. Evidence / Comparison Description (10 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-:|------------------|
| 9–10  | Describes a sensible comparison or relationship (e.g., before/after, across regions) |
| 6–8   | Reasonable idea but loosely articulated |
| 3–5   | Mentions data but no clear comparison |
| 0–2   | Not addressed |

---

## Section C: Understanding USDA NASS Data (30 points)

### Q7–Q13 (scored holistically)

| Score | Criteria |
|-:|------------------|
| 26–30 | Strong understanding of NASS structure, sources, aggregation, and limitations |
| 20–25 | Mostly correct with minor misunderstandings |
| 12–19 | Surface-level understanding; largely descriptive |
| 0–11  | Significant confusion or minimal engagement |

**Look for evidence of:**

- Correct unit of observation (state–year)
- Awareness that NASS relies on surveys and estimates
- Sensible explanations for missing values
- Recognition of unobserved variation (e.g., farm-level practices, weather heterogeneity)

---

## Section D: Applying Data to the Question (15 points)

### Q14–Q15. Adjusted NASS Query & Drought Data

| Score | Criteria |
|-:|------------------|
| 13–15 | Data choices clearly align with the policy question; datasets are well described |
| 9–12  | Mostly correct but incomplete descriptions |
| 4–8   | Data downloaded but weak connection to the question |
| 0–3   | Minimal or incorrect response |

---

## Section E: Working with R & Logs (10 points)

### Q16–Q17. `glimpse()` Interpretation & Log File

| Score | Criteria |
|------:|------------------|
| 9–10  | Correct interpretation of console output; log file runs cleanly |
| 6–8   | Minor misunderstandings or formatting issues |
| 3–5   | Log file exists but interpretation is weak |
| 0–2   | Missing or nonfunctional log |

---

## Section F: Reflection & Synthesis (10 points)

### Q18–Q19. Reflection Paragraph

| Score | Criteria |
|-:|------------------|
| 9–10  | Thoughtful reflection on decision → question → data process and limitations |
| 6–8   | Reasonable reflection but superficial |
| 3–5   | Mostly summary with little insight |
| 0–2   | Minimal or off-topic |

## Instructor / TA Notes

- This rubric prioritizes **reasoning over technical precision**
- High-scoring responses explicitly acknowledge **data limitations**
- Encourage partial credit where students engage thoughtfully, even if imperfect
