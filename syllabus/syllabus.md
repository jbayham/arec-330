## Course Description

The world generates 2.5 quintillion bytes of data each day. One of the key modern business challenges is transforming that data into actionable insights that improve decision making (i.e., data-driven decision making). Transforming data into information is not magic. It requires understanding the decision problem, organizing and processing data, analyzing data, and finally presenting information. This course will introduce you to this process of transforming data into actionable insights and build a core set of competencies with modern software. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students should be able to:

1.  Recognize how to efficiently acquire data from a variety of sources

2.  Implement best practices for using software

3.  Demonstrate data literacy

4.  Use R and data visualization tools to read, manipulate, and organize data in a variety of structures and formats

5.  Examine real-world business and policy questions using appropriate data, analytical techniques, and visualizations

6.  Support business and policy recommendations by conveying findings as a comprehensive story in a manner appropriate for business settings and policy makers

7.  Construct appropriate summary statistics and analyses to inform business and policy decisions

8.  Design interactive data visualizations to inform business and policy decisions

This course will contribute to several DARE Learning Outcomes:

- You will develop **Technical Competence** and **Problem-solving Skills** while studying *Ag Business* and *Environmental and Resource Economics* issues, not to mention, learning to code in R and developing visualizations in Tableau.

- You will develop **Communication Skills** and **Leadership** skills as you work in teams on problem-driven projects and communicate the results of your analyses to the instructors and your peers.


## Course Materials and Software

All [course materials](../course-materials) are freely available on the course website. There is no single textbook that you need to purchase. Copyright restricted materials will be posted on the [Canvas site](https://colostate.instructure.com/courses/218386). 

The course will require the use of [R (statistical computing software)](https://www.r-project.org/) and its companion [RStudio (integrated development environment)](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). You can download R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) here: <https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html>. After installing R, you can download and install RStudio from here: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>. Detailed instructions for installing R and RStudio are here : <https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html>.
. R is an open source platform free to anyone. You will need to use these tools outside of class, so we recommend installing them on your own computer. Otherwise, it will be your responsibility to use the computer labs outside of class to complete assignments.

We will also use Github throughout the semester. Please sign up for a github education account to get free access to these tools: <https://github.com/education/students>. A bonus of using github is that you will have access to GitHub Copilot, an AI coding assistant that can help you write code faster and with less effort.



We will use iClicker software to take attendance at lecture and assess understanding of the material. If you have not already joined the course, you can do so using this link: <https://join.iclicker.com/NBFG>>

## Course Structure

The course is designed to introduce you to essential data analysis skills as well as effective communication of data insights. The first half of the course will focus on building foundational skills in data acquisition, cleaning, manipulation, and visualization using R. The second half of the course will emphasize applying these skills to real-world problems through projects and presentations.

### Assignments

The first part of the course will consist of problem sets that will help you build your skills in R and data analysis. 

### Exams

There will be a midterm and final exam to assess your understanding of the course material. The exams will focus on concepts covered in the course. These exams will be on paper in class.

### Projects

The second part of the course will involve a modeling project where you will apply the skills learned in class to a real-world problem. You will work in teams to complete the project, which will culminate in a written report and presentation.

Many careers require teamwork in some form. In this course, you will work in teams to complete your assignments and present your work. Team projects will train students to collaborate with peers as they likely will do in the workplace. Group work can also lead to freeriding so, students will evaluate themselves and each other after each project. The evaluation will provide the students the opportunity to explain their contribution and those of their peers. The instructors will be available to resolve disputes within a team. However, the most productive arrangement for this class (and in your future workplace) is to communicate expectations with your colleagues and do your part of the project.

### Student Websites 

Students will create a website that will serve as a repository for their project and assignments. If this is your first time creating a website, we recommend [google sites](https://sites.google.com) - a free and easy to use website editing and hosting tool. It will also serve as a record of their work in a presentable format that can be shared within or outside of CSU. *There are many other tools for building and hosting websites. Please come talk to us if you have another option in mind or would like learn a more advanced option.*

### Attendance and Participation 

There will be iClicker questions incorporated into most lecture materials. These questions are intended to test understanding of lecture materials and provide the instructors with real-time feedback on comprehension. Responses will account for a small portion of the overall course grade.




## Course Expectations and Policies

We will communicate with you through your CSU email and through Canvas. Email is the best way to reach us. When many students have the same kind of question, we may reply to the entire class or post documents on the class website.

During class, please limit use of phones and tablets to class-relevant activity. Be respectful of each other and your instructors/TA. Much of the course content will require the use of computers. Please use laptops and lab computers appropriately (do not watch media in class).


## Assignments and Grading

| Component                | Percentage |
|--------------------------|------------:|
| Problem sets (∼4)       | 20%        |
| Midterm Exam            | 20%        |
| Final Exam              | 30%        |
| Modeling project        | 25%       |
| Participation           | 5%         |

I will use the standard CSU grading scale including + and - where the thresholds are defined at 2 and 8 of each 10-point range.

### Homework

There will be about 4 problem sets covering the material and tools covered in class. The problem sets will constitute the majority of the work during the first part of the course. 

### Exams

There will be a midterm and final in-class exam. The exams will be written and not require you to run code on a computer. The final exam will be cumulative. 

### Modeling Project

As part of this course, you will complete an applied modeling project that allows you to integrate the optimization techniques learned in class with your research interests. The project has three main components:

- **Model Identification and Replication**: Select a peer-reviewed journal article or working paper that includes a mathematical programming model (linear, nonlinear, or dynamic). You will analyze the structure of the model, including its objective function, constraints, and underlying economic rationale. Then, replicate the model using R, using your own code and data where appropriate.

- **Model Extension**: Propose and implement a meaningful extension to the original model. This could involve relaxing an assumption, adding a constraint, changing the objective function, introducing stochastic elements, or embedding the model in a dynamic framework. The goal is to demonstrate your ability to not only understand existing models but also contribute original insights.

- **Written Report and Presentation**: Submit a short technical report (approximately 5–8 pages) describing the original model, your replication results, your extension, and the economic interpretation of your findings. The report should include code snippets and relevant figures or tables. You will also give a brief presentation of your project at the end of the semester.

- **Deliverables**:

    - Project Proposal: Submit a one-page proposal identifying your chosen article, model type, and intended extension.

    - Final Report and Code: The code must be reproducible.

    - Presentation: During the final two weeks of the course

## Principles of Community

The Principles of Community support the Colorado State University mission and vision of access, research, teaching, service and engagement. A collaborative, and vibrant community is a foundation for learning, critical inquiry, and discovery. Therefore, each member of the CSU community has a responsibility to uphold these principles when engaging with one another and acting on behalf of the University

*Inclusion*: We create and nurture inclusive environments and welcome, value and affirm all members of our community, including their various identities, skills, ideas, talents, and contributions.

*Integrity*: We are accountable for our actions and will act ethically and honestly in all our interactions.
Respect: We honor the inherent dignity of all people within an environment where we are committed to freedom of expression, critical discourse, and the advancement of knowledge.

*Service*: We are responsible, individually and collectively, to give of our time, talents, and resources to promote the well-being of each other and the development of our local, regional, and global communities.

*Social Justice*: We have the right to be treated and the responsibility to treat others with fairness and equity, the duty to challenge prejudice, and to uphold the laws, policies and procedures that promote justice in all respects.

## Academic Integrity

Academic misconduct (see examples below) undermines the educational experience at Colorado State University, lowers morale by engendering a skeptical attitude about the quality of education, and negatively affects the relationship between students and faculty/instructors.

Faculty/Instructors are expected to use reasonably practical means of preventing and detecting academic misconduct. Any student found responsible for having engaged in academic misconduct will be subject to academic penalty and/or University disciplinary action.

Students are encouraged to positively impact the academic integrity culture of CSU by reporting incidents of academic misconduct.

Examples of academic misconduct include (but are not limited to):

1.	Cheating – Cheating includes using unauthorized sources of information and providing or receiving unauthorized assistance on any form of academic work or engaging in any behavior specifically prohibited by the instructor in the course syllabus or class presentation.

2.	Plagiarism – Plagiarism includes the copying of language, structure, images, ideas, or thoughts of another, and representing them as one’s own without proper acknowledgment, and is related only to work submitted for credit. Also included is the failure to cite sources properly; sources must always be appropriately referenced, whether the source is printed, electronic or spoken.

3.	Unauthorized Possession or Disposition of Academic Materials – Unauthorized possession or disposition of academic materials includes the unauthorized selling or purchasing of examinations, term papers, or other academic work; stealing another student’s work; and using information from or possessing exams that an instructor did not authorize for release to students.

4.	Falsification – Falsification encompasses any untruth, either verbal or written, in one’s academic work.

5.	Facilitation of any act of Academic Misconduct – Facilitation of any act of academic misconduct includes knowingly assisting another to commit an act of misconduct.

## AI Tools Policy

AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) are powerful tools, and learning to use them is valuable. However, they can undermine efforts to learn economic concepts in this course. Please make every effort to understand the material. 

Be aware of the limits of ChatGPT:

- If you provide minimum effort prompts, you will get low-quality results. You will need to refine your prompts in order to get good outcomes. This will take work.

- Don’t trust anything it says. If it gives you a number or fact, assume it is wrong unless you either know the answer or can check in with another source. You will be responsible for any errors or omissions provided by the tool. It works best for topics you understand.

- AI is a tool, but one that you need to acknowledge using. Please include a paragraph at the end of any assignment that uses AI explaining what you used the AI for and what prompts you used to get the results. Failure to do so is in violation of the academic honesty policies.

- Be thoughtful about when this tool is useful. Don’t use it if it isn’t appropriate for the case or circumstance.
